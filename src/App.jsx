        <p>Nezuko is a young girl with fair skin, visibly large, prominent fangs,
         a slender build, and sharp, stiletto nails with a base color of light pink
          and ombre fading to a red-pinkish color at the end where they point. 
          Her hair is long, black, and wavy. It reaches just below her waist, turning
         a flame-orange color as it passes her elbows, and appears to be crimped into 
          large, straight ridges, worn side-swept drastically to her left. She has soft-looking,
          pale pink eyes that appear a lighter color around the rims of their irises and on the
          center a persian pink below the pupils; they slanted downwards toward the sides of her face 
         and framed by notably long eyelashes. Her pupils appear as black slits as she transforms. 
         In the manga, Nezuko can sometimes be shown with more than one bow. According to Tanjiro, 
          Nezuko was known as a great beauty in their home town.She wears a light pink kimono with an
          asanoha hemp leaf pattern, the lining a paler pink layered with the white yuban underneath as a short trailing skirt kimono
         to freely move as a demon, secured by a red and white-checkered hanhaba obi with an orange-threaded obijime and a green obiage.
         Over this, she sports a long, dark-brown haori that reaches her calves, as well as a pair of z≈çri with pink straps and white tabi 
         socks, wrapped with thick pieces of black material resembling kyahan. Nezuko also wears a small pink ribbon on the left side of
         her head to keep her hair out of her face, along with the bamboo muzzle Giyu Tomioka gave her, which is secured around her
         jaw with a strip of red cloth.</p>
